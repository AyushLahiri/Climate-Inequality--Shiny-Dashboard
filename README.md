# Climate Change - Disparity in Responsibility and Impact
[View the Dashboard](https://ayushlahiri.shinyapps.io/Climate_Inequality/)
## Executive Summary
This project investigates the disparity in responsibility and impact of climate change from 1960 to 2020. It focuses on the correlation between CO2 emissions and climate change indicators, highlighting the urgent need for global action.

## Data Sources
1. **NOAA Data**: Global carbon dioxide concentrations, sea level changes, surface temperature changes.
2. **EM-DAT**: Frequency of natural disasters.
3. **Climate Watch**: Per-capita and national greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide).
4. **ND-GAIN Country Index**: Readiness and vulnerability scores.
5. **Penn World Table (PWT) 10.01 & IMF DOTS**: Trade value extraction data.
6. **Lucas Chanel (2022)**: Region-wise per capita CO2 estimates by income group.
7. **Nestpick**: Habitability predictions for global cities by 2050.
8. **World Bank's GNI per capita dataset**: Country-wise income group classification and per capita income.

## Analytical Framework and Techniques
- **Analytical Approach**: The project employs segmentation and aggregation of data by income group, transformation based on economic theories, and comparative analysis of related data.
- **Visualization Focus**: Emphasis on using R-based tools (ggplot2, Plotly, Leaflet) for data visualization to enhance data storytelling. Techniques include line plots, scatter plots, stacked bar plots, and bubble charts to effectively communicate complex data patterns.
- **Objective**: To unravel the dynamics of climate change responsibility and impact, highlighting the disparity between high and low-income countries and individuals.

### Summary of Findings
- Climate change is marked by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily CO2.
- Rising global temperatures, sea levels, and frequency of natural disasters correlate strongly with these emissions.
- The project aims to explore who is most responsible for these emissions globally and the proportionality of their consequences.
- High-income countries are the largest per capita contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.
- There is a significant disparity in climate change effects across economic sectors and nations.
- High-income countries show lower susceptibility and higher preparedness for climate impacts, unlike low-income countries.
- Vulnerability and readiness for climate change are influenced by natural factors and infrastructural preparedness.
- Historical and contemporary economic dynamics play a crucial role in the disparity of resources to address climate change.
